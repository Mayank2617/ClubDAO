## üåê Live Demo
Check out the live project: [ClubDAO on Render](https://club-dao-delta.vercel.app/)

## Overview

**Club DAO** is a decentralized application (DApp) designed for student clubs or organizations at universities. It integrates **AI-driven task management**, **voting mechanisms**, and **attendance tracking** to streamline club operations. Instead of utilizing real blockchain networks, the project simulates blockchain functionality and leverages the **Hugging Face API** for AI-powered task automation and management.

### Key Features

1. **Blockchain Simulation for Secure Transactions:**
   - Simulated blockchain transactions ensure the transparency and security of processes like voting and attendance tracking.

2. **AI-Driven Task Management:**
   - AI-powered task automation via **Hugging Face API** to suggest optimal task assignments, track progress, and prioritize tasks based on urgency.

3. **Voting Mechanism:**
   - A decentralized, transparent voting system to facilitate decision-making processes for club elections or events, ensuring fairness.

4. **Attendance Monitoring:**
   - Real-time attendance tracking with the ability for students to request exemptions based on specific conditions, making attendance management more efficient.

5. **Faculty Dashboard:**
   - Faculty members can approve attendance exemptions and send the approved list to the dean, with full control over the process.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain Simulation:** Simulated blockchain network to ensure transparency and secure transactions (no real blockchain interactions).
- **Hugging Face API:** Used for AI-driven task automation and management.
- **React.js:** Frontend framework for the user interface.
- **TailwindCSS:** For responsive, modern UI design.
- **Web3.js or ethers.js (Simulated):** For interacting with the simulated blockchain.
- **Node.js:** Backend for managing API requests and business logic.
- **MongoDB or Firebase:** For storing non-sensitive data (e.g., student profiles, task assignments).
- **MetaMask:** Wallet integration for interaction with the simulated blockchain.
- **IPFS (Optional):** Used for decentralized file storage if needed.
